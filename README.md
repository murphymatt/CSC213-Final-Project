In order to interact with the system, make and then run ./main from the io directory. A prompt will appear in standard output with a list of possible actions. From here, the instructions should be clear, but see the example below for a reference on what typical input should look like. When adding or deleting a node, the user must specify the node type (student or class), and the value associated with that node. The user may also search...

Following an interaction with the user input prompt, all of the data in the graph is written to a file. Therefore if a user wants to view all of the contents of the databse, they may open this file. The file contents are displayed as: 

File Format: 
first line:  Type, Value; Type2, Value2; etc
subsequent: Type, Value; Type2, Value2; Type3, Value3 where Value has an edge with Value2, and Value3
